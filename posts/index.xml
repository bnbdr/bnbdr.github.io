      <description>For the uninitiated, typeracer.com is a website that allows you to test your typing speeds against other people using segments of text from different sources.
Judging by the relatively copious number of races I&amp;rsquo;v partaken in - I probably liked it: Who&amp;rsquo;s my opponent? A big factor in typeracer is your average WPM1. I came to the realization that my most challenging opponent was myself - I had to beat my own average score every race so I won&amp;rsquo;t lower it.</description>

      <description>The UI on https://xkcd.com was a tad annoying on mobile so I&amp;rsquo;d written this page that would load random comics as you scroll.
All credit for the original comics goes to Randall Munroe.</description>

      <title>SwissCheese - Exploiting The Pattern Matching Swiss Knife</title>

      <description>Cheese, Gromit In this short incredibly lengthy post I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the binary format of YARA rules and also a bit about exploiting two vulnerabilities I found in it.
I named this SwissCheese becuase I found it amusing that the &amp;ldquo;Pattern Matching Swiss Knife&amp;rdquo; had quite a few holes in it ;D
The two issues were assigned the CVE-IDs CVE-2018-12034 and CVE-2018-12035 and affect YARA 3.7.1 and earlier. If you want to skip straight to the exploitation part, go to WAT or take a look at the repo.</description>
